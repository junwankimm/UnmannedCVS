# UnmannedCVS
Real-Time Object Detection for Unmanned CVS

Baseline Code : https://github.com/CaptainEven/MCMOT-ByteTrack
which is inspired by https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack, https://github.com/noahcao/OC_SORT

First, We modified the baseline code to to track customers in store
Second, We modified the baseline code to track objects and match with tracked customer in order to discriminate which customer takes the object.
Last, We print out a reciept for each customer when the customer leaves the store

Code can be run in the same way of Baseline Code
